            <h2>Pasta carbonara</h2>
            <p>Carbonara (Italian: [karboÀànaÀêra]) is a pasta dish made with fatty cured pork, hard cheese, eggs, salt, and black pepper.[1][2][3][4][5][6] It is typical of the Lazio region of Italy. The dish took its modern form and name in the middle of the 20th century.[7]

            The cheese is usually pecorino romano. Some variations use Parmesan, Grana Padano, or a combination of cheeses.[6][8][9] Spaghetti is the most common pasta, but rigatoni or bucatini are also used. While guanciale, a cured pork jowl, is traditional, some variations use pancetta,[6][5] and lardons of smoked bacon are a common substitute outside Italy.</p>

            <h2>pizza</h2>
            <p>The history of pizza began in antiquity, as various ancient cultures produced flatbreads with several toppings. Pizza today is an Italian dish with a flat dough-based base and toppings, with significant Italian roots in History.

                A precursor of pizza was probably the focaccia, a flatbread known to the Romans as panis focacius, to which toppings were then added.[1] Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, between the 16th and mid-18th century.[2][3]
                
                The word pizza was first documented in 997 AD in Gaeta[4] and successively in different parts of central and southern Italy. Pizza was mainly eaten in Italy and by emigrants from there. This changed after World War II, when Allied troops stationed in Italy came to enjoy pizza along with other Italian foods.</p>
