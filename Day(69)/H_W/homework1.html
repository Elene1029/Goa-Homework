            <h1 class="h1">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned<br> were current, if not more so, 
            in the company I joined. I <br>honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h1>
            <p class="p2"> “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a<br> 
            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
            for<br> the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
            The next 12<br> weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
            the course, I’ve <br>successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

            <p class="p11">“ I started as a total newbie with <br>virtually no coding skills. I now work<br> as a mobile engineer 
            for a big<br> company. This was one of the best<br> investments I’ve made in myself. ”</p>

            <h1 class="h5"> Such a life-changing <br>experience. Highly<br> recommended!</h1>
            <p class="p14"> “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve<br> never written a line of code. I needed <br>some structure from 
            professionals <br>who can help me learn programming <br>step by step. I was encouraged to<br> enroll by a former 
            student of theirs<br> who can only say wonderful things<br> about the program. The entire<br> curriculum and staff 
            did not<br> disappoint. They were very hands-on<br> and I never had to wait long for<br> assistance. The agile team 
            project, in<br> particular, was outstanding. It took<br> my learning to the next level in a way<br> that no tutorial 
            could ever have. In<br> fact, I’ve often referred to it during<br> interviews as an example of my <br>developent 
            experience. It certainly <br>helped me land a job as a full-stack<br> developer after receiving multiple<br> offers. 
            100% recommend! ”</p>

            <h1 class="h3"> Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp<br> themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
            learning from <br>their experiences was easy.</h1>
            <p class="p8">  “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The <br>program 
            gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present<br> myself as a capable 
            junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal<br> attention you need from 
            an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>
