           <h2>4.History of the firearm</h2>
           <p>Throughout history, soldiers have sought new ways to protect their bodies from the weapons of war. As armament technology was developed, so to did armor. As with many early technologies, it is not known when and where armor was first implemented. It is likely many different people in many different countries found ways to clothe themselves against harm.

            Non-metal armor rotted over time, leaving no physical remains. Later examples and illustrations, together with studies by anthropologists, point towards the possibilities. Leather was probably one of the earliest materials used for armor and remained popular down the millennia thanks to its durable and flexible nature.
            
            Layers of cotton or other cloth provided padding against blunt attacks but could be vulnerable to sharper weapons which developed with the use of metalsmithing. Wood has even been used for armor in some places, for example by the Siberian Chukchi people.</p>
